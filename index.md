# 👋 Hi, I'm Chukwuemeka Ezeliora

I'm a final-year Computer Science student and aspiring Cloud & DevOps Engineer. I have hands-on experience deploying full-stack applications, building CI/CD pipelines, and implementing cloud infrastructure using tools like **AWS**, **Docker**, **GitHub Actions**, **Terraform** and **kubernetes**.

Currently, I'm working on my project — a **Cloud-Based Continuous Monitoring System for Microservices** — where I'm exploring the use of observability tools and automated alerting in real-time systems.
